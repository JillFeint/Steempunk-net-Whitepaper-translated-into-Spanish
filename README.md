# Steempunk-net-Whitepaper-translated-into-Spanish
 This is the spanish translation of  whitepaper of steampunk-net. v1.0

 >The idea
 In this concept we will create the first steps of establishing a Multiplayer Online Role Playing
 Game based upon the steemit blockchain.
 Player should have the possibility to challenge other players and attack them, while the 
 opponents are able to defend themselves. This very basic thought should be based upon the
 blockchain of steemit, which limits player numbers to all steemit users at maximum.
 The game itself should enhance the user experience on steemit and support the active
 collaboration on this platform. Actions that are in favor of exactly doing that are rewarded in
 different ways within the game, we will explain this more in detail in the upcoming chapters.
 Setting this game into the steampunk genre and accompanying it with a rich storyline is
 adding atmosphere and also creates the opportunity to identify with the character that the
 user is playing. - Steempunk-net whitepaper
